**MY FIRST MARKDOWN!**

**Installing the right tools**

This project presented me with new knowledge as I learned why would I want to use a Virtual machine and a Vagrant instead of just using my local machine. That knowledge let me to know two types of tools that we in the alx community are going to use. Even though there are other altinative tools, the tools that we use are: Virtual box and Vagrant

**What is new?**

Now that I have installed these two tools on my computer. I am able to run my projects from my command prompt. It is also important to remember that the checker from the sanbox wont be effective when I use my checker and that is because the checker will be ran using the new tools I have installed.

**Markdown**

With everythihng setup for my project, all that was left was for me to clone an existing repo were I would be creating my first Markdown. I watched a couple of videos on youtube to familiarize myself with Markdown, as well as used the study material provided by the school.
